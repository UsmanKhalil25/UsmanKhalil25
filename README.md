# Hey there, I'm Usman ðŸ‘‹

I build stuff with **TypeScript** and **Python** (yes, I hate JS â€” don't @ me).

I also use **Vim** and **Arch** btw
*(Because suffering is character-building... right?)*

## What I Work With

### Languages & Frameworks
- **TypeScript / JavaScript** â€” _(Next.js, React, Vue.js, Nest.js)_
- **Python** â€” _(FastAPI supremacy)_
- **Go & C++** â€” _(when things get serious)_

## Current Status

- Junior Software Engineer @ Verdant Soft since March 2024  
- CS Student @ FAST NUCES Lahore
- Probably tweaking my Neovim config again or configuring a new windows manager in arch
